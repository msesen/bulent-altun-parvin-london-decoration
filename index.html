        <p><strong><u>BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, I PERSONALY DO NOT RECOMMEND CONTRACTING HIM OR/AND HIS BUSINESS FOR BUILDING OR RENOVATION WORK AT ALL COST!</u></strong></p>

        <p>I wanted to renovate the house. The job required swapping the kitchen and the living rooms. This meant that the boiler and the gas pipes needed to be rerouted from the old room (kitchen) to the new room (living room) and vice versa.</p>

        <p>I have started getting quotes in December 2024 and decided to go with Bulent Altun - G.D PARVIN LONDON DECORATION LTD. He came into my property twice prior to the start of the work. I have explained to him what I wanted done and we agreed on the initial cost - which was £16400 including the cost of the materials and labour. I have also asked him to install new laminates on the first floor so it would match the ground floor laminates because the old ones needed to be ripped apart for rerouting the pipes, which he quoted me £3000 (I later found out that this was way too much!). There were additional costs such as painting the walls of the stairs which he charged me £400. </p>

        <p>In total, I have paid him £20,900.00 (£19,000 cash, £1,900.00 bank transfer to his business account). I was forced by Bulent Altun to pay in cash. He was asking for payments every other day and he told me he wouldn't be able to complete the job if I didn't pay in cash. I was assured that he will provide me with a receipt for the payments for the whole sum after the work had been completed. I didn't have a choice but to pay him so the work would be completed. Once the work was completed, he refused to give me an invoice and receipts for the cash payments.</p>
        
        <p>He started the work on the 9th of January 2025, and according to him, it was all completed to a satisfactory standard in the first week of February 2025. But in reality the work was done poorly.</p>

        <p>
            <i>
                <strong>As of today (28th of February, 2025) I am tired chasing him to correct his mistakes or do a partial refund so I can get someone else to redo some of the work. I wanted to share my experience and what I went through. I will report him to Trading Standars and take legal action.</strong>

        <p class="font-rem2"><strong>I will briefly demonstrate the poor work he has done and left me with. Please continue reading.</strong></p>

        <div class="videos">
            <p>First of all, let's make it clear that it was him who done the work. This is him providing updates to me as he was doing the work. He has used a WhatsApp group to post photos of the work as it was done.</p>

            <p>This is him telling me the upstairs laminates are done and asking me to pick a stairs nosing to complete the job.</p>

            <h3>Defective and Dangerous!</h3>
            <p>The laminate floors started expanding literarily a day after he took the full payment.</p>
            <img class="width-100 mb-1rem" src="/images/laminates-expansion.jpg" alt="Laminates expanding">

            <p>He ruined my entrance hall, it is now not at a straight level (has a slight downwards angle/slope as you walk towards the kitchen) and the laminates are breaking apart! My assumption is that he did not level the floor properly after installing the pipes to save money on the material costs.</p>

            <p>One of the radiators did not work at all! I had to chase him to get it sorted and the radiator valve is not at an 90 degrees angle (like the one on the left) and the wall behind it is poorly finished!</p>

            <p>He has cheaped out and wrongly installed the kitchen waste water pipe! He should have directly connected the waste pipe to the manhole which is just outside the kitchen near the window! He has put a long drainage pipe all the way from the kitchen sink (window) to where the boiler is! I now have this long - dead pipe sitting inside my wall!</p>

                <p>As a result of the above wrong installation of the kitchen waste water pipe, I have the following happening everytime I flush some water.</p>
