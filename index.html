    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>In December 2024, I obtained quotes for a house renovation project. The agreed scope included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Swapping the kitchen and living room (requiring boiler and gas pipe rerouting).</li>
      <li>Installing new laminate flooring upstairs to match the ground floor.</li>
      <li>Painting stairwell walls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The agreed cost was £16,400 for materials and labour, plus £3,000 for laminates and £400 for painting. In total, I paid £20,900 (£19,000 in cash, £1,900 by bank transfer).</p>

    <h2>Payment Issues</h2>
    <p>Payments were requested in cash on multiple occasions, with assurances that receipts would be provided after completion. Despite repeated requests, no receipts or invoices were issued for the cash payments.</p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>Work began on 9 January 2025 and was declared complete in early February 2025. I observed multiple defects shortly after completion.</p>

    <h2>Documented Defects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Laminate flooring:</strong> Expansion and cracking occurred within days. The entrance hall floor was uneven, with a slope toward the kitchen.</li>

            <p>The presence of a metal object protruding from the brick wall built by Mr Bulent Altun indicates poor construction practices and a failure to meet acceptable professional standards.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>As of 28 February 2025, I have been seeking corrections or a partial refund. I am pursuing the matter through Trading Standards and legal channels.</p>
