      <li>Company number: 12810405</li>
      <li>Address: Flat 5, 219–221 Hertford Road, Enfield, England, EN3 5JH</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Project Background</h2>
    <p>In December 2024, I obtained quotes for a house renovation project. The agreed scope included:</p>
    <ul class="info-list">
      <li>Swapping the kitchen and living room (requiring boiler and gas pipe rerouting).</li>
      <li>Installing new laminate flooring upstairs to match the ground floor.</li>
      <li>Painting stairwell walls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The agreed cost was £16,400 for materials and labour, plus £3,000 for laminates and £400 for painting. In total, I paid £20,900 (£19,000 in cash, £1,900 by bank transfer).</p>

    <h2>Payment Issues</h2>
    <p>Payments were requested in cash on multiple occasions, with assurances that receipts would be provided after completion. Despite repeated requests, no receipts or invoices were issued for the cash payments.</p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>Work began on 9 January 2025 and was declared complete in early February 2025. I observed multiple defects shortly after completion.</p>

    <h2>Documented Defects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Laminate flooring:</strong> Expansion and cracking occurred within days. The entrance hall floor was uneven, with a slope toward the kitchen.</li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <br><br>
      
        <li><strong>Radiator installation:</strong> One radiator was initially non-functional. Valve alignment and wall finishing were inconsistent.</li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <br><br>

        <li><strong>Kitchen waste pipe:</strong> Installed with a long internal dead pipe rather than direct connection to the external manhole.</li>
        <li>

            <div class="videos">
                <p>As a result of the above wrong installation of the kitchen waste water pipe, the following happened everytime I flushed some water.</p>

        <br><br>

        <li><strong>Brickwork:</strong> Bricks used did not match existing ones. Mr. Altun stated originals were unavailable, but subsequent checks showed they were still widely available.</li>

            <p>The presence of a metal object protruding from the brick wall built by Mr Bulent Altun indicates poor construction practices and a failure to meet acceptable professional standards.</p>

        <br><br>

        <li><strong>Copper tubing:</strong> Hot and cold-water pipes were installed directly on top of each other without insulation, embedded in concrete without protection.</li>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>As of 28 February 2025, I have been seeking corrections or a partial refund. I am pursuing the matter through Trading Standards and legal channels.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Based on my documented experience, I personally would not recommend contracting this business for building or renovation work. The information provided here is intended to share my observations and evidence with others considering similar services.</p>
